"""
Tenant-safe inbound correlation (spec section 17).

Exercises the real inbound-processing path (mail.reply_handler_v2.
process_inbound_email_v2) against a fully isolated, in-process SQLite
database seeded with two organizations that both have a contact using
the *same* email address -- the scenario where cross-tenant leakage
would actually show up. This is not a code-inspection assertion; it
persists real rows and calls the real function end to end.

Isolation note: this file does NOT import mailer_agent.db (whose engine
is a module-level singleton bound once, at first import, to whatever
DATABASE_URL happened to be set by whichever test file's import ran
first in the session -- a real fragility other test files here work
around with `os.environ.setdefault(...)` before their first
mailer_agent import). Instead it builds its own SQLAlchemy engine/session
directly and passes that Session into process_inbound_email_v2, which
takes a Session as a plain parameter. That sidesteps the shared-singleton
problem entirely rather than depending on import order.
