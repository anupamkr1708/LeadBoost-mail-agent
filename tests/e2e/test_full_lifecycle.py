"""
Deterministic end-to-end suite (spec sections 40-42).

What "deterministic E2E" means here, concretely:
  - REAL: FastAPI HTTP layer (fastapi.testclient.TestClient against the
    actual app and its actual routers), real Pydantic request/response
    validation, real SQLAlchemy persistence, and the real worker-side
    functions (send_initial_outreach, process_inbound_email) -- not
    reimplementations of them.
  - FAKE: the LLM provider (tests/fake_llm_provider.py, via the autouse
    `fake_llm` fixture from conftest.py) and the SMTP transport (achieved
    by leaving LIVE_SENDING_ENABLED at its default False, which is
    mail/sender.py's own built-in deterministic dry-run path -- it
    returns a real, correctly-shaped SendResult without touching a
    socket, rather than needing a separate hand-rolled fake SMTP server).

What's deliberately NOT exercised here: the real APScheduler background
threads (main.py's lifespan would start those against whatever
mailer_agent.db.engine happens to be bound to, which is a session-wide
singleton this file has no reliable control over -- see
test_tenant_correlation.py's module docstring for the same issue). This
file constructs its own isolated engine/session per test and overrides
FastAPI's get_db, then calls the actual worker functions
(send_initial_outreach, process_inbound_email) directly with that
session, simulating "a scheduler tick fired" deterministically instead
of waiting on a real timer. This is what section 42 asks for
("real... scheduler/worker BEHAVIOR") without the flakiness of actually
running a background thread inside a test.

Auth: the app's require_api_key / get_current_org_id dependencies are
overridden directly rather than relying on environment variables, since
api/deps.py builds its key->org map once at import time (another
session-wide singleton) -- overriding the dependency callables is the
robust way to control auth in tests regardless of import order.
