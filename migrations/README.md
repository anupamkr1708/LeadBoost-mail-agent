# Migrations

This project does not use Alembic for schema migrations, even though
`alembic` is listed in requirements.txt (it isn't currently wired up --
there is no `alembic/versions` directory). Introducing Alembic now, against
a database that may already have been migrated by these hand-rolled scripts
in an unknown subset/order, was judged riskier than documenting what's
actually here. If you want to move to Alembic, `alembic revision
--autogenerate` against a freshly-migrated database is the safe starting
point -- don't try to reconstruct history retroactively.

Instead, every script here is a standalone, **idempotent** Python script:
each one only adds a column/index/constraint if it doesn't already exist
(`add_column_if_not_exists`, `create_index_if_not_exists`, or the
equivalent inline pattern), so re-running any of them against a database
that's already up to date is a safe no-op. That's why running them out of
order is lower-risk than a normal ordered migration chain would be -- but
"lower risk" is not "no risk" (a later script's index can still depend on
an earlier script's column existing), so use the order below.

## Canonical order

Run once, in this order, against a fresh or partially-migrated database:

1. `001_production_hardening.py` -- organization_id + timezone on
   campaigns, unique constraints, indexes, send-attempt tracking fields.
2. `002_constraints_and_multitenancy.py` -- contact/message uniqueness
   constraints, organization_id on suppression_list, FK cascade
   documentation, hot-path indexes.
3. `002_work_claiming.py` -- **canonical** work-claiming migration:
   `claimed_by` / `claimed_at` on contacts, plus the composite
   `(status, next_action_at)` index the work-claim query in
   `followup/work_claiming.py` actually uses.
4. `../migrate_db.py` (repo root, not in this directory) -- semantic
   intelligence + state-machine columns: `last_reply_at`,
   `last_outbound_at`, `buying_stage`, `engagement_score`,
   `semantic_analysis`, `classification_success`,
   `classification_failure_reason`.
5. `003_message_id_unique_constraint.py` -- unique constraint on
   `messages.message_id_header`, closing a check-then-insert
   deduplication race under true concurrency (see the migration's own
   docstring, and `tests/test_postgresql_concurrency.py`). Checks for
   existing duplicate values first and refuses to apply (with a clear
   error) rather than silently failing mid-`ALTER` if any are found.
6. `004_external_dispatch_and_campaign_integration_source.py` -- Phase C
   (LeadBoost integration) schema: `campaigns.integration_source` +
   `uq_campaigns_org_integration_source`, and the new
   `external_dispatches` table backing
   `POST /integrations/leadboost/outreach-actions`
   (`mailer_agent/api/integrations.py`). Purely additive; does not
   change any existing column's type or nullability, and NULL
   `integration_source` (every pre-existing campaign) is unaffected by
   the new unique index. See the migration's own docstring for why the
   new table is created via `ExternalDispatch.__table__.create(...,
   checkfirst=True)` rather than hand-written DDL.

7. `005_external_dispatch_grounding_context.py` -- C9.2: nullable JSON
   `external_dispatches.grounding_context`, the immutable per-dispatch
   grounding snapshot written by
   `POST /integrations/leadboost/outreach-requests`
   (`mailer_agent/api/integrations_generated.py`). Purely additive; NULL for
   every existing row and every exact-message dispatch (the worker then
   grounds exactly as before). The only migration here with a
   `--downgrade` (drops the column, discarding any snapshots written since).
   **Apply before deploying C9.2 code:** the ORM selects this column on
   every `ExternalDispatch` query, including the existing worker's claim
   path, so code deployed ahead of the column fails on first use.

8. `006_mailboxes.py` -- M1: the Mailer-owned `mailboxes` table
   (`mailer_agent/models.py::Mailbox`, API in `mailer_agent/api/mailboxes.py`).
   Purely additive; nothing existing reads or writes it yet (M2/M3 wire it in).
   Created via `Mailbox.__table__.create(..., checkfirst=True)` (same pattern
   as 004), so it coexists with `init_db()`'s `create_all()`: whichever runs
   first creates the table, the other no-ops. Has a `--downgrade`, which is
   **destructive**: it drops the table and every stored mailbox record and
   encrypted credential. SMTP/IMAP passwords in this table are Fernet
   ciphertext produced with the deployment's `MAILBOX_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (never
   stored in the database): losing or changing that key makes stored
   credentials unreadable, and restoring a backup requires the same key.
   Security boundary: this protects credentials in database dumps/backups and
   against direct database reads; it does NOT protect against compromise of
   the application host, where the database connection and the key coexist.
   Uniqueness is `(organization_id, email_address)` and `public_reference`.
   **M3 consideration:** two organizations may register the same address, so
   per-mailbox IMAP polling could poll one physical inbox twice. M3 does NOT
   deduplicate physical inboxes: each Mailbox is its own inbound identity, and
   a message is stored once per (mailbox, Message-ID), so each organization
   that receives it keeps its own record (see migration 009). Do not give two
   Mailboxes IMAP access to the same physical account unless both organizations
   are meant to receive its mail.

9. `007_external_dispatch_mailbox.py` -- M2-A: nullable
   `external_dispatches.mailbox_id` (FK -> `mailboxes.id`, RESTRICT). Apply
   BEFORE deploying M2-A. Dispatches still QUEUED at deploy time have NULL
   `mailbox_id` and will FAIL pre-SMTP as `no_mailbox` (they never send through
   the old global SMTP identity): drain the queue first, or accept those
   failures (callers retry with a new idempotency key).

10. `008_external_dispatch_deferred_message.py` -- M2-B:
    `external_dispatches.message_id` becomes NULLABLE (PostgreSQL
    `DROP NOT NULL`; no-op on SQLite, which is built from the models). Apply
    BEFORE deploying M2-B and after 007. The new internal state `generating`
    needs no DDL. Downgrade refuses to run while any row has NULL `message_id`.

**Deployment note (as of this migration):** none of these eight scripts are
run automatically by this repo's `render.yaml` -- its `buildCommand` only
installs dependencies. Until a pre-deploy migration step is added (tracked
separately), apply new migrations manually, in the order above, before
deploying application code that depends on them -- in particular, deploying
the Phase C integration endpoint without first running `004_...py` (or the
C9.2 code without `005_...py`) against that environment will 500 on first use.

## Known duplicate

`002_add_work_claiming.py` adds the same two columns as
`002_work_claiming.py` -- both exist because they were written
independently at different points. It is **not** deleted (a real
deployment may have already run it, and rewriting migration history a
production database may have already applied is riskier than leaving a
confirmed-safe duplicate in place), but it is marked deprecated in its own
docstring and is safe to skip for new deployments: `002_work_claiming.py`
is the canonical one and additionally creates the composite index the
work-claim query needs, which the deprecated file does not.

The "002" prefix collision between the three files in this directory is
intentional-by-accident (two different concerns both landed on "002" at
different times) rather than a real ordering conflict -- all three are
idempotent and safe to run in the order listed above regardless.

## Running

```
python migrations/001_production_hardening.py
python migrations/002_constraints_and_multitenancy.py
python migrations/002_work_claiming.py
python migrate_db.py
python migrations/003_message_id_unique_constraint.py
python migrations/004_external_dispatch_and_campaign_integration_source.py
python migrations/005_external_dispatch_grounding_context.py
python migrations/006_mailboxes.py
python migrations/007_external_dispatch_mailbox.py
python migrations/008_external_dispatch_deferred_message.py
```

To revert 005 only: `python migrations/005_external_dispatch_grounding_context.py --downgrade`.
To revert 006 only (destroys all mailbox records/credentials): `python migrations/006_mailboxes.py --downgrade`.
To revert 007 / 008: `--downgrade` on each (008 refuses while any dispatch has `message_id` NULL).

Safe to re-run the whole sequence any time; every step no-ops on columns/
indexes/constraints that already exist.

10. `009_messages_mailbox_scoped_dedupe.py` -- M3: nullable `messages.mailbox_id`
   (FK -> `mailboxes.id`, RESTRICT) and the replacement of the global
   `uq_messages_message_id_header` constraint by two partial unique indexes:
   `UNIQUE(message_id_header) WHERE mailbox_id IS NULL` (exactly the old rule for
   every existing row: outbound, webhook, legacy-global-IMAP) and
   `UNIQUE(mailbox_id, message_id_header) WHERE mailbox_id IS NOT NULL` (the
   mailbox-bound inbound identity). Apply BEFORE deploying M3 code: the ORM
   selects `messages.mailbox_id` on every Message query. Idempotent; has a
   `--downgrade` that refuses to run if a Message-ID is now stored more than
   once. SQLite note: an inline UNIQUE from pre-M3 `CREATE TABLE` cannot be
   dropped there -- recreate development databases from the models.
