"""
Standalone worker process: runs the reply-poll and follow-up/dispatch
jobs on their own schedule, with no HTTP server attached.

Deploy this as a Render "Background Worker" (start command: ``python
worker.py``) alongside a separate "Web Service" running the FastAPI app
(start command: see Procfile). Keeping them as two processes means the
API can scale (multiple gunicorn workers) without ever running the
scheduler more than once -- if the scheduler ran inside every gunicorn
worker process, you'd get duplicate sends and duplicate reply
processing.

For local development, you don't need this at all: ``python run.py``
with the default RUN_SCHEDULER_IN_PROCESS=true runs everything in one
process.

Phase 7 — Scheduler ownership
------------------------------
The scheduler is deliberately split from the API process:

* ``run.py`` / ``mailer_agent/api/main.py`` lifespan handler:
  Only starts the scheduler when ``RUN_SCHEDULER_IN_PROCESS=true``
  (the default for single-process local dev).  When set to false (the
  recommended production setting) the API process logs a warning and
  never starts any APScheduler jobs -- it is purely an HTTP server.

* ``worker.py`` (this file):
  Always starts the scheduler.  In production, exactly one instance of
  this process should run (Render Background Worker, or a single
  container replica).  Having exactly one scheduler process means there
  are never duplicate reply-poll or follow-up-dispatch cycles from the
  scheduler side.

* Residual duplicate-work risk:
  Even with one scheduler, if a job cycle takes longer than its
  interval the next run begins while the previous one is still active.
  APScheduler's ``max_instances=1`` per job prevents this (any
  overlapping trigger is silently skipped).  For the remaining
  concurrent-worker case (two ``worker.py`` processes running
  simultaneously, e.g. during a rolling deploy), Phase 8's database-
  level work claiming (SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED) is the defence.

Phase 8 — Graceful shutdown and claim release
----------------------------------------------
On shutdown (KeyboardInterrupt / SIGTERM), this process releases any
work claims it currently holds so the next worker cycle (possibly on a
newly-started worker) can pick them up immediately rather than waiting
for the lease to expire (default 300 s).

SIGTERM (fix): the code above only ever ran on KeyboardInterrupt. Python's
default SIGTERM action terminates the process immediately WITHOUT raising
SystemExit, so on a platform that stops services with SIGTERM (Render) the
release logic never executed. ``install_signal_handlers()`` converts SIGTERM
into SystemExit so the shutdown path below actually runs.

LeadBoost ExternalDispatch shutdown ordering (``graceful_shutdown``):
  1. stop taking NEW external-dispatch claims;
  2. stop the scheduler (no new job triggers);
  3. wait a bounded time for in-flight dispatches to finish on their own;
  4. dispatches THIS process still owns after the drain deadline are moved
     SENDING -> UNKNOWN, by dispatch ID + claim token (never by worker_id
     alone, never to QUEUED -- an interrupted send cannot be assumed unsent);
  5. release Contact claims as before.
