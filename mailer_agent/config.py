"""
Central configuration for the Mailer Agent.

Every tunable value (SMTP/IMAP creds, LLM model/key, poll intervals,
default follow-up cadence, safety toggles) lives here as an environment
variable with a sane default. No module outside this file should read
os.environ directly -- that is what makes the rest of the codebase free
of hardcoded behavior: change behavior by changing env vars / API
payloads, not by editing source.

    # --- LeadBoost integration (Phase C) ----------------------------------
    # KNOWN OPEN ITEM, recorded explicitly rather than guessed around (see
    # Batch 1 report): the LeadBoost integration's request contract
    # (mailer_agent/api/integrations.py) deliberately carries no `sender.*`
    # block -- LeadBoost's own OutreachAction already stopped sending SMTP
    # credentials over the wire, and this integration goes further and
    # sends no sender identity at all, per request. But Campaign.sender_name
    # / sender_org / sender_email are NOT NULL columns (see models.py), and
    # the one, fixed, per-organization "leadboost" integration Campaign
    # (get-or-created by api/integrations.py) still has to satisfy that
    # constraint at creation time -- there is no way around this without
    # either (a) making those columns nullable (a real schema change to an
    # existing table used by every other campaign, explicitly out of scope
    # for this batch) or (b) putting a sender.* block back in the request
    # body (explicitly rejected by the brief this batch was built against).
    #
    # The smallest valid solution that adds no new architecture and
    # changes no existing table's nullability: a fixed, deployment-level
    # sender identity for the LeadBoost integration specifically,
    # configured here exactly like every other tunable value in this file
    # (SMTP_HOST, IMAP_HOST, etc.) -- NOT a per-organization value, and
    # explicitly flagged as such. This mirrors the SMTP settings' own
    # pre-existing shape: this codebase already sends every ordinary,
    # non-integration campaign through one deployment-wide SMTP identity
    # (smtp_username/smtp_password above) regardless of which
    # organization's campaign it is, so a single deployment-wide sender
    # identity for the one LeadBoost-integration campaign per org is not a
    # new kind of limitation, just the same existing one applied to a new
    # campaign.
    #
    # Fails closed (see api/integrations.py's get-or-create): if
    # leadboost_integration_sender_email is empty, the *first* LeadBoost
    # dispatch for any organization returns 503 rather than silently
    # inserting a placeholder/garbage sender identity into a real Campaign
    # row. Once any organization's integration Campaign has been created,
    # subsequent requests for that org reuse the existing row and do not
    # re-check this setting.
    #
    # Real per-organization sender identity (e.g. derived from LeadBoost's
    # own verified EmailAccount, passed once at credential-provisioning
    # time rather than per-request) is an explicit open item for a later
    # phase (see the Batch 1 report's "SENDER IDENTITY DECISION" section),
    # not solved here.
    #
    # SCOPE OF THIS DECISION (Batch 1.1, stated explicitly per review):
    # one deployment-wide sender identity is acceptable for a controlled
    # staging environment, or for the current deployment topology where
    # one Mailer Agent instance serves a small, known set of LeadBoost
    # organizations under one operator's control. It is NOT a complete
    # per-organization sender architecture, and must not be treated as
    # production-ready for arbitrary multi-customer use: every
    # organization's LeadBoost-integration mail would go out under the
    # same From: identity, which is unacceptable once distinct customers
    # need their own sending domain/reputation. Do not remove this
    # caveat by quietly expanding scope in a later batch without
    # actually building the per-org mechanism described above.

    # per-socket-operation timeout, up to 3 attempts, and a blackholed
    # connect to a multi-address host can legitimately exceed 300 s. An
    # expired SENDING lease resolves to UNKNOWN (never QUEUED, never an
    # automatic resend -- see models.resolve_expired_sending_lease), so an
