"""
Exact-message execution boundary for externally-authorized outreach (C5).

LeadBoost hands the Mailer Agent an *already-authorized* subject and
body. For this integration path those two strings are the single source
of truth: they are persisted once (as one ``Message`` row) and must
reach ``send_email()`` unchanged. This module is the one place that
contract is expressed in code, so a future change cannot quietly route
the path through drafting, personalization, or a "helpful" fallback.

The authoritative values are ``Message.subject`` / ``Message.body``.
Nothing here keeps a second mutable copy: ``ExactSendInput`` is a frozen
value built from the persisted Message at the moment of hand-off.

What lives here
---------------
  create_authorized_message()
      Builds -- does NOT add/flush/commit -- the one Message for an
      operation. It takes no session, so it cannot create a second row:
      ONE authorized operation -> ONE Message is structural. (The name
      says "create" in the domain sense; nothing is persisted here.)

  build_exact_send_input() -> ExactSendInput
      The value a later stage (C7) passes to send_email().

  evaluate_exact_message_grounding() -> ExactGroundingDecision
      The established hard-block safety net, reusable by C7. Read-only.

Purity: no I/O of its own
-------------------------
No session is created, used or committed here, and there is no network,
SMTP or LLM call. Precisely: the functions *read attributes* of the ORM
objects they are handed; on an expired instance that read may lazy-load
through the caller's session. They never write, flush, or commit.

Allowed imports (enforced by tests/test_exact_message_boundary.py, as an
allowlist plus a fresh-interpreter runtime check):

  * ``mailer_agent.models``          -- Message/Contact/Campaign + enums
  * ``mailer_agent.llm.grounding``   -- validate_grounding (regex only)
  * ``mailer_agent.semantic_models`` -- GroundingValidation (result type)
  * stdlib: ``__future__``, ``dataclasses``

Deliberately NOT imported, even lazily -- each one loads the LLM layer
and/or SMTP (verified by importing them in a fresh interpreter):

  * ``llm.agent`` / ``draft_message``  -- message generation.
  * ``mail.sender`` / ``smtplib``      -- sending belongs to a dispatcher
    that *consumes* ExactSendInput (C7), not to this module.
  * ``memory.store``      -- ``build_conversation_context`` lives there,
    but that module imports ``llm.provider``.
  * ``followup.engine``   -- home of ``is_suppressed``, but it imports
    ``llm.agent`` and ``mail.sender``.

Subject semantics
-----------------
``subject=None`` (permitted by the request schema) is handed off as
``""`` because ``send_email(subject: str)`` requires a str. This is a
transport representation, not a new subject: at the MIME layer ``None``
and ``""`` both serialize to an empty ``Subject:`` header (verified), and
``Message.subject`` itself stays None. A subject is NEVER invented -- not
from ``campaign.sender_org`` (what the legacy approve path does), the
campaign name, a template, or an LLM.

Grounding inputs and known limitations
--------------------------------------
Same validator, same fields as the legacy approval gate, except the
transcript: see ``evaluate_exact_message_grounding``. This is NOT full
parity with the legacy gate. Also, the integration campaign has no
operator-approved proof_points, so metric/dollar/headcount/time claims
hard-block until an operator supplies grounding evidence (fail-closed).

Not done here (later stages) and what C7 will need
--------------------------------------------------
SMTP, worker claiming, lease recovery, Message-ID persistence,
reconciliation -- and:

  * Message-ID: ``send_email()`` mints its own ID internally
    (``make_msgid``) and only *returns* it. A Message-ID persisted before
    the SMTP call would therefore NOT be the one transmitted. C7 needs a
    backward-compatible optional ``message_id_header`` parameter on
    ``send_email()`` and a matching field on ExactSendInput. Neither is
    added here: nothing can consume them yet, and ``sender.py`` is out of
    scope for C5.
  * The suppression check and the ``live_sending_enabled`` gate that
    ``approve_and_send_draft`` applies (in dry-run ``send_email()`` returns
    SENT without sending). Both need an LLM-free home.

Future-stage invariant (nothing here contradicts it): an expired
ExternalDispatch SENDING lease resolves to UNKNOWN, never back to QUEUED
and never an automatic resend -- see ``models.resolve_expired_sending_lease``.
This module changes no state.
